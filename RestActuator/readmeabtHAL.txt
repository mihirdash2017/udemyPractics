Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is an Internet Draft (a "work in progress") standard convention for defining hypermedia such as links to external resources within JSON or XML code (however, please note that the latest version of HAL Internet-Draft expired on November 12, 2016.). The standard was initially proposed on June 2012 specifically for use with JSON[1] and has since become available in two variations, JSON and XML. The two associated MIME types are media type: application/hal+xml and media type: application/hal+json.[2]
